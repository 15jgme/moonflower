		Hi! For transparency we want to provide a quick note on the cookies we use on this site. Because
		this site uses server side rendering we need to have some way of injecting your authentication
		status between request sent from your browser to server side functions. We do this with a single
		cookie that stores your credentials. We may implement a second cookie at some point to let you
		change your theme but we will NOT use cookies for anything else!
